Hi Mike.

It's me, Alex's Gibbs sampler.

You can run me like this:

mike@mikebox:$ python sampler.py <length of l-mers> <number of iterations for which nothing changing constitutes "convergence">

Don't forget those parameters. It feels all weird when someone runs me without them. Or worse, with extras. Ew.
